It is built on top of <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">D3.js</a> and empowers developers to use svg to display any data in a simple and intuitive way.</p><p>This is accomplished by providing a shape template system that allows to develop any required node visualization and simply using it in a data-driven manner.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The development of Graphly D3 was motivated by the need to visualize rather complex knowledge graphs. This required the ability to visualize nodes in a way that was easy to understand and interact with. The solution was to develop a shape template system that would allow developers to create and use any node visualization by simply pointing to it in a node&#39;s data.</p><p>During the development of the project, we decided to release Graphly D3 as open source and put it under the <a href="https://github.com/LiveReader/graphly-d3/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GPLv3 license</a>. Now it can be easily installed in your project via npm, providing you with a simple yet powerful way to visualize your graph data.</p>',6),c=e("h2",{id:"features",tabindex:"-1"},[a("Features "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#features","aria-hidden":"true"},"#")],-1),u=e("p",null,[a("The graph visualization itself is implemented as a force-directed graph.
